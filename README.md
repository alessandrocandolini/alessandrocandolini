### Hi there 👋

I'm Alessandro

- 🔭  I've been working at [Depop](https://depop.com/) for the past five years as technical lead and scala / backend staff engineer. Find out more about my current and past roles in my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocandolini/) or this [cv](https://github.com/alessandrocandolini/cv-public) (proudly typeset in LaTex :D ) 
- 💬 Ask me about .. anything! I'm always keen to chat about any topic, particularly physics, mathematics, programming, business, blues, books, ocktails &  gin 🍸
- I've never had a chance to actively contribute to open source projects yet, but I usually open source most of the things i do in my spare time, in case someone else finds them useful. In my github account you'll find a variety of different things, including some latex notes and slides (about physics, math, programming, and statistics); playground projects for different programing languages, libraries, and tools (eg, scala, haskell, TLA+, CI/CD); various giter8 templates to generate new projects; and more. 
- 🌱 Among my favourite topics in programming: pragmatic, strongly statically typed functional programming; architecture, design, and implementation of concurrenct and distributed systems; correctness of computer programs (TDD, PBT, formal specification and verification, TLA+, etc) 
- my favourite programming languages: Scala & Haskell
- 💰 do you have a lot of money and you want to invest them on a new business? Write to me, I might know the ninjia team that can make it happen quickly and robustly, but we are not cheap
- 📫 How to reach out to me: alessandro.candolini@gmail.com, [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocandolini/) , or open a bug in one of my repos 😄 
- I own another github account https://github.com/acando86 that i only use at work
