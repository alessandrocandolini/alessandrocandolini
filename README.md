### Hi there 👋

I'm Alessandro

- 🔭  I've been working at [Depop](https://depop.com/) over the last four years as tech lead and senior scala / backend software engineer. Find out more about my current and past roles in my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocandolini/) or [cv](https://github.com/alessandrocandolini/cv-public) (proudly typeset in LaTex :D ) 
- 💬 Ask me about .. anything! I'm always keen to chat about any topic, particularly physics, mathematics, programming, technology, business, wine, cocktails &  gin 🍸
- 🍝 don't ask me to cook food. I'm very bad at cooking, despite being Italian. I'm trying to improve though :) 
- I haven't had a chance to actively contribute to open source projects yet, but I try to open source most of the things i do in my spare time, in case someone else finds them useful. In my github account you'll find a variery of different things, including some latex notes and slides (about physics, math, programming, and statistics); playground projects for different programing languages, libraries, and tools (eg, scala, haskell, TLA+, CI/CD); various giter8 templates to generate new projects; and more. 
- 🌱 Among my favourite topics in programming: pragmatic functional programming, design and implementation of concurrency and distributed systems, testing and verification of computer programs, etc
- 💰 do you have a lot of money and you want to invest them on a new business? Write to me, I might know the ninjia team that can make it happen quickly and robustly, but we are not cheap
- 🎵 alternatively, do you have a lot of money and you want to launch a blues bar and you want to be sure that it will never be successful? Then i might be the right person for you. But i still have the dream to launch a blues / jazz bar, one day
