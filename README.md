### Hi there 👋

I'm Ale

- 🔭 for the past 6+ years I've been working at [Depop](https://depop.com/) where I solve business and commercial problems and delight Depop users through technology. As a member of the engineering leadership, I work closely with C levels and senior leadership in shaping the longer-term technical strategy and vision within the organisation and I'm directly responsible of leading a number of company-wise engineering iniatives at scale while having fun implementing backend technical solutions using Scala and functional programming (among other things). Find out more about my current and past roles on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocandolini/) or read my [cv](https://github.com/alessandrocandolini/cv-public) (proudly typeset in LaTex :D not very parsable by automatic tooling :D ) 
- 💬 Ask me about .. anything! Always keen to have a chat about all sort of topics: physics, mathematics, functional programming, business, blues, books, gin 🍸
- Not very active on open source, but love to share publicly here whatever I'm currently working on (even if not completed). In my github account you'll find a variety of different things, including latex notes and slides (about physics, math, programming, and statistics); playground projects for different programing languages, libraries, and tools (eg, scala, haskell, TLA+, CI/CD); various giter8 templates to generate new projects; and more. 
- 🌱 Among my favourite topics in programming: pragmatism & strongly statically typed functional programming; concurrency and distributed systems; correctness of computer programs (TDD, PBT, formal specification and verification, Agda, Stainless, TLA+, etc). Generally interested in the intersection between technology and business, wisely using advanced concepts when appropriate to reliably deliver robust solutions in a timely manner
- my favourite programming languages: Scala & Haskell
- 💰 do you have money and you want to invest on a new business but not sure how to tackle the development of a digital product? Write to me, I might know a trustable ninjia team that can make it happen quickly and robustly, but we are not cheap! 
- 📫 How to reach out to me: alessandro.candolini@gmail.com, [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrocandolini/) , or open a bug in one of my repos 😄 
- I own another github account https://github.com/acando86 that i only use for work
